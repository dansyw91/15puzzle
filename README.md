# 🧩 15 Puzzle — Classic Sliding Puzzle Game (C++)

Welcome to the **15 Puzzle** — a timeless logic game where you slide numbered tiles into the correct order!  
This project is built entirely in **C++**, focusing on clean design, object-oriented programming, and operator overloading practice.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Arrange the tiles in order from **1 to 15**, leaving the **last space empty**.  
Sounds simple? Try it — and see how fast your brain can shuffle and solve!

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🧮 **Randomized starting layout** each time you play  
- 🎮 **Move tiles interactively** using keyboard input  
- 🚫 **Move validation** (no illegal moves!)  
- 🔄 **Operator overloading practice** for modern C++ learning  
- 📊 **Move counter** to track how efficient you are  
- 💾 **Clean, modular code** written with reusability in mind  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++17  
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Key Concepts:** Operator Overloading, Encapsulation, Randomization  
- **Compiler:** Any modern C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`, MSVC)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash  
git clone git@github.com:dansyw91/15puzzle.git  
cd 15puzzle
```

2. **Compile the program**  
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -I include -o 15puzzle src/*.cpp
```

3. **Run the game**  
```bash
./15puzzle
```

Have fun and good luck!🤪  
  
  
💡 Tip: Each move counts — can you solve it in the fewest steps possible?

📚 Learning Focus  
This project was created as part of my C++ practice journey, especially focusing on:

Operator overloading

Dynamic memory and resource management

Logical thinking through algorithm design

Writing maintainable, expressive code

🌟 Future Improvements  

🖥️ Add a simple graphical interface (SDL / SFML)

🧮 Implement an AI auto-solver

⏱️ Add a timer and best score tracker

💬 Add a leaderboard for local high scores
